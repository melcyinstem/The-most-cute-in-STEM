Once said... Meine.name.ist.Melcy 
˚ · • . ° . I will take this to the next level programming in German for 2024 ˚ · • . ° .

Looking Barcelona around to **be part of the STEM world. I can apply my knowledge and skills to solve real problems and contribute to the advancement of science and technology**

In high school I question myself what my career will be. Wich path would be mine I have always been clear that my goal was to train in STEM to be able to work in a modern company with technology and creative staff. I chose subjects such as industrial technology and the one that changed the way I see everything was computer science, which on the first day we touched programming. This has allowed me to develop the skills and abilities necessary for the world. I have learned to work as a team, communicate effectively and solve problems. More than adapting to changes being part of the change. In addition I have done internships where I have been able to apply the knowledge acquired and learn from the experience of other professionals. With the bases, attitude and desire to “Run towards the roar" that in Spanish is ☾ ⋆*･ﾟ"Corre hacia el rugido" my favourite book: "La ley de Murphy" :⋆*･ﾟ
